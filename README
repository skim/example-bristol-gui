Graphical user interface for the bristol synthesizer emulation 
(http://bristol.sourceforge.net, author: Nick Copeland). Written in 
ANSI-C, using the GTK. bristol-gui is Free Software, see the 
"License" section.

This software compiles and runs only on Linux and BSD systems.
It's purpose is to provide a graphical user interface for the 
bristol synthesizer emulation. Since there is no equivalent to JACK
or ALSA on MS Windows based operating systems, porting would make
no sense at all.
